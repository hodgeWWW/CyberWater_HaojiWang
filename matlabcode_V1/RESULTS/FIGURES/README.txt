This folder contains the Figures from the papers with the following clarifications:

Figure 2A in the paper corresponds to the parameter "mode" = "full" used in the Matlab Script:

The difference between the different modes indicated in the Matlab is related to computation time one wants to spend on the calculation.

The results in Figure 2B are slightly different from the one shown in the paper because the figure provided here is based on a single simulation 
using the entire data-set, while the version in the paper uses the mean results from 500 simulations using Bootstrap 
(resampling with replacement) from the original data-set. However, one can write his/her own codes based on the codes we provided
to obtain the results for 500 simulations using the Bootstrap methodology. But one can see that the pattern between this single simulation and the  
mean results from 500 simulations is similar. 

The results in Figure 2C are pre-loaded from a previously run script for the sake of performance as it takes a relatively long time to complete.

Figure 5 is a similar case as Figure 2A, the results shown here are slightly different from the ones shown in the paper because results here are 
based on a single simulation using the entire data-set, while the results shown in the paper are the mean results from 500 simulations using 
Bootstrap (resampling with replacement) from the original data-set. Similar to Figure 2B, one can write his/her own codes based on the codes 
we provided to obtain the results for 500 simulations using the Bootstrap methodology. But one can see that the pattern between this single 
simulation and the mean results from 500 simulations is similar.
